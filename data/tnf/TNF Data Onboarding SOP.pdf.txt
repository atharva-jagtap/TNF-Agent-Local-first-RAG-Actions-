TNF Data Onboarding SOP (v1.0)

Purpose
- Standardize onboarding of new data sources into TNF.

Prerequisites
- Source owner assigned
- Data contract completed
- Schema JSON approved

Steps
1) Register source in TNF Console → Sources → “Register Source”.
2) Provide schema.json and sample file (min 100 rows).
3) Set Refresh Times in the Data Ingestion settings for this source:
  - Hourly at :10 and :40 (IST).
4) Enable Quality Checks: null_ratio < 5%, unique_keys enforced.
5) Submit for Review → “Create Pull Request” in tnf-ingestion repo.

Failure Modes & Fix
- Schema mismatch: update schema.json + re-run dry run.
- Late arrivals: increase late_arrival_window to 25m.
